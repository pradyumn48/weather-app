**Dashboard.js**: The Dashboard component presents a user-friendly interface with a background image and a form allowing users to input city and country details. Additionally, it includes a "Get Weather" button that, when clicked, triggers the retrieval of weather information based on the provided city and country data.

**WeatherDetails.js** : The WeatherDetails component provides a platform to showcase weather details fetched from an external API, utilizing data retrieved through React Router's useLocation hook. This enables users to access comprehensive weather information corresponding to the selected city and country from the dashboard.

**Form.js** : The Form component facilitates user interaction by providing input fields for city and country selection, along with a "Get Weather" button. Upon clicking the button, it triggers the retrieval of weather information using an external API. Additionally, it utilizes React Router's useNavigate hook to navigate to the WeatherDetails component, passing the fetched weather data as state.

**Information.js**: The Information component serves as a visually appealing display for weather details obtained from an external API. It showcases essential weather information including location, temperature, humidity, sunrise and sunset times, weather conditions, and cloud coverage. Additionally, it provides error handling to prompt users to input values for weather retrieval when necessary, enhancing the user experience and comprehension of weather data.

**Api.js** : The api.js module facilitates communication with an external weather API by providing a function getWeather for retrieving weather data based on the specified city and country. It utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests and handles error cases gracefully by logging any encountered errors. This module enhances the application's functionality by enabling seamless integration with weather data sources, thereby enriching the user experience with accurate and timely weather information.

**App.js** : This File utilizes React Router to manage navigation within the application. It sets up routes for the Dashboard and WeatherDetails components, ensuring smooth transition between the two pages. This allows users to seamlessly interact with the weather application, accessing both the input interface and detailed weather information display.
